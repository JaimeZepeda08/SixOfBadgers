Bidding: Starting from the player to the left of the dealer, each player has the option to "order up" the face-up card as the trump suit by saying "I order it up" or to pass by saying "Pass." If all players pass, the dealer has the option to pick up the card themselves and choose the trump suit or pass again, leading to a new round of bidding.

Playing the hand: If a player successfully orders up the face-up card or if the dealer picks it up, the suit of that card becomes the trump suit. The player who ordered or picked up the card's suit becomes the "maker" and plays alone against the other three players.

a. The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick by playing any card from their hand.

b. Players must follow suit if possible; if they can't, they can play any card.

c. The highest card of the led suit or the highest trump card wins the trick.

d. The winner of each trick leads the next one.

Scoring: The makers aim to win at least three tricks to score points. If they succeed, they earn one point. If they win all five tricks, they earn two points. If the makers fail to win three tricks, they are "euchred," and the opposing team earns two points.

Rotation: After scoring, the deal rotates clockwise, and a new hand begins.

Winning: The game typically continues until one team reaches a predetermined score, often 10 points, to win.
